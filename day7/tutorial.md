# Functions
A Function of code that can be executed by calling its name

  It is best to name function after verbs. Functions are not executed until their name is called with parenthesis(). wrting the function name simply refernces the function itself.

    Fuctions can accept pararmeters (often called arguments). A pararmeter/ argument is data type or object that the function will operate on.
    pararmeter/arguments are placed in the parenthesis when calling the Function. Multiple argument are separated by a comma.


    Even if a function takes no arguments you still have to write the parenthesis to execute it.
